# Poker Chips Helper

A mobile application to assist a poker host with determining the denominations and distributions of poker chips.

This applications uses the React Native + Expo framework and by extension is primarily implemented in typescript. These frameworks were chosen for their solid reputation, and ability to easily compile to both major platforms (iOS + Android) with a single code base. Typescript is the default language for new projects with these frameworks, but is also preferred over the javascript alternative as strong typings are very helpful to the developer experience.
